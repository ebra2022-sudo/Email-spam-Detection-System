Hidden problem in the Naive Bayes model.
A hidden problem in the current model is impacting its performance.
Let's delve into the issue by manually performing the Naive Bayes computation on a specific example.

spam_likelihood: 0.0
ham_likelihood: 0.0
This is weird, both spam and ham likelihood are 0
! How can it be possible? By the way, by the actual rule, the model classifies as 1 (spam) if spam\_likelihoodâ‰¥ham\_likelihood
, so this email would be classified as spam. Let's compare the true and predicted labels."""
